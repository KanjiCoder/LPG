    Ever here of "not made here syndrome?"

    Well, I tried to be a good boy and not re-invent the
    wheel. It is 2022 and you'd think someone has already
    done this... But no...

    All the other Javascript .PNG libraries are either:

    1. Decoder Only
    2. Node.js Only 
    3. 8 Bit Indexed Color Only
    
    I've tried to make a .PNG encoder/decoder before and
    failed horribly... New strategy...

    We are going to very carefully transcribe LODE.PNG
    into Javascript. We will emulate "malloc" and "free"
    by storing an "Array" of "Uint8Array".

    For example:

        p_mybytearray = F_LPG_MAL( 512 * 512 * 4 );

        lpg_mem[ p_mybytearray ][ 12 ]=( 34 );

//:====================================================:ABOUT://
//:STRATEGY:=================================================://

    We will use "overwhelming force" to accomplish...
    We will code review EVERY FUCKING GOD DAMNED LINE
    ON VIDEO AND UPLOAD IT TO YOUTUBE SHORTS. Every
    line of code gets a detailed explanation.
       
    ( as detailed as can be in under 1 minute )

    We will write the code slowly... Build it up...
    And hopefully be finished by the time I need it.
